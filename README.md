## Description

Grab is a biggest transportation company in Asia. Grab has many services such as GrabCar, GrabBike, Grab Delivery, GrabSubscription, and GrabFood. Some of their service are not available on some country. In Indonesia, GrabFood has more attention from customer because of its low prices than original price of the food. Grab always give promos for their customer

GrabFood as part of Grab is serve as an application based on Android and iOS devices. In GrabFood, the customer order foods in their application and a Grab driver will order the actual food in the actual restaurant and deliver it to the customer address.

As the one of the most used service in Indonesia with a good competitor in the same field, GrabFood has to deliver an amazing user interfaces and user experiences for keeping their customer to use their apps and services.

## Bad UI and UX

We think that the bad UX is on the checkout page. If we want to change the drop off location, we must back to the main page of GrabFood and can't change directly from checkout page.
