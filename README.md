## Description

Grab is a biggest transportation company in Asia. Grab has many services such as GrabCar, GrabBike, Grab Delivery, GrabSubscription, and GrabFood. Some of their service are not available on some country. In Indonesia, GrabFood has more attention from customer because of its low prices than original price of the food. Grab always give promos for their customer

GrabFood as part of Grab is serve as an application based on Android and iOS devices. In GrabFood, the customer order foods in their application and a Grab driver will order the actual food in the actual restaurant and deliver it to the customer address.

As the one of the most used service in Indonesia with a good competitor in the same field, GrabFood has to deliver an amazing user interfaces and user experiences for keeping their customer to use their apps and services.

## Bad UI and UX

### Cannot change location from the checkout menu

![Checkout Page](src/checkout-1.jpg)

We think that the bad UX is on the checkout page. If we want to change the drop off location, we must back to the main page of GrabFood and can't change directly from checkout page.

### The payment method and promo button are plain like its not a button

![Checkout Page](src/checkout-2.jpg)

From the picture we can see that the payment method section written Tunai(Cash). The payment method section in the picture is like an information served to the customer. But, the fact is that the payment method section is a button that can be clicked to change the payment method. Same case applied for promo section.

### Hard to figure how to change the quantity of a food.

![Checkout Page](src/checkout-1.jpg)

There is no information how to change the quantity of a food in the checkout menu. The information available is only the number of quantity already ordered by customer.

### Search bar doesnt have filter option.

![Search Bar](src/no-search-filter.jpg)

GrabFood's search bar doesnt have filter to filter the search result. The customer cannot search food or restaurant based on the lowest price, nearest distance, the most rated, or the type of the food.
